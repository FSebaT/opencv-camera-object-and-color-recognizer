# opencv-camera-object-and-color-recognizer
Repository where you will find a project of a robot with a camera that, using a raspberry pi 4, was programmed to recognize objects of color and distance from one to another in order to control a servomotor that serves as direction of the same robot where the entire system is mounted.

1- The first step is to have a raspberry pi, then install its operating system to start working with the camera.
2- Install python on the raspberry, if you don't know how you can follow this tutorial:  https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/generic-python-install-python3#linux
3- Install opencv, if you don't know how you can follow this tutorial: https://descubrearduino.com/opencv-en-raspberry-pi/
4- It's time to connect the camera and program everything in Python to achieve our goal, which is to differentiate 2 colors and identify which one is farther and closer.
5- I will leave several codes so you can try them and modify them to your liking.
