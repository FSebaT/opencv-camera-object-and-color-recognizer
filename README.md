# opencv-camera-object-and-color-recognizer
Repository where you will find a project of a robot with a camera that, using a raspberry pi 4, was programmed to recognize objects of color and distance from one to another in order to control a servomotor that serves as direction of the same robot where the entire system is mounted.
